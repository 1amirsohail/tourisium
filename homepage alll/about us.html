                        ZEB TRAVELS was established 40 years ago in Karachi, Pakistan by Khawaja Jahan Zeb and is one of
                        the oldest and well known travel and tourism companies in Pakistan. It all started in a small
                        office run by a young Khawaja Jahan Zeb who, fascinated by travelling from a young age on, knew
                        that this profession was his calling in life. A whole new world in tourism opened up and over
                        the years he was able to create a variety of new ideas in the field of travel in Pakistan. The
                        company grew steadily under his guidance and his will to continuously promote the importance of
                        tourism in and for Pakistan has remained steadfast to this day. He has represented Pakistan in
                        various worldwide exhibitions and conventions, giving him the chance to promote this country as
                        a tourist destination on an international platform as well.

                <p style="text-align: justify; color: grey;">

                    Having worked in this field since a very young age, I developed an early love for travelling and
                    everything that has something to do with tourism. From an early stage of my life I was especially
                    interested in exploring my own country, Pakistan, which offers an amazing variety of superb holiday
                    destinations. During my extensive travels over the years in Pakistan, I believed I had visited every
                    corner of this country, but to my surprise, on each new journey I discovered a part of my country
                    that I had never experienced before.

                    Throughout the years I have strived to attain several goals:

                    To emphasize the importance of “domestic travelers” and to increase awareness amongst my fellow
                    Pakistanis about the beauty of their own country. To invite and serve people from all over the world
                    who have developed a love for Pakistan. Until today many customers return, and many continue to keep
                    in touch with us, recalling the “Adventure Pakistan” that they had had the chance to experience. To
                    encourage my countrymen to travel abroad and experience new cultures and meet new people in order to
                    expand the horizons of their mind as well as their knowledge. And last but not least, to encourage
                    our youth to participate in school trips in order to change attitudes and raise aspirations through
                    new activities and experiences. Rising to new challenges and living alongside their peers helps
                    pupils become more adaptable and confident; aspects which are critical to so many areas of their
                    development.

                    All these travelers help foster an understanding between people, providing a cultural exchange
                    between both hosts and guests and increasing the chances to develop mutual sympathy and
                    understanding towards our country while at the same time reducing their prejudices; an aspect much
                    needed in these times.

                    Tourism, one of the world’s largest industries, is at the forefront of new world conflicts, but from
                    my experience, the tourism industry has developed a capacity to adapt and survive with extraordinary
                    resistance towards these issues. I am convinced that the passion and desire to travel, to experience
                    new places and to meet new people will take tourism to new heights as the years go by. Especially
                    now, in the field of sustainable tourism, where locals and visitors have encounters that will
                    benefit all those involved, including the local environment.

                    I hope to see tourism in Pakistan increase in the future, bringing with it all its benefits and
                    capacity to increase interaction and understanding between different people. There is much to be
                    done and I will continue pursuing my life passion in the hope that one day everyone gets the
                    opportunity to experience what traveling could mean for them.

                    This is something that I think, with your help, we can achieve and it would be my pleasure to invite
                    you on this exciting journey that I like to call, TRAVELLING….
